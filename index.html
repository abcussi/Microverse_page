      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Michael's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1958</strong> - Born in Gary, Indiana</li>

        <li><strong>1964</strong> - Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which
          included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.</li>

        <li><strong>1968</strong> - The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records;
          their
          first single, "Big Boy", was released</li>

        <li><strong>1970</strong> - In January, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one
          the US
          Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks.</li>

        <li><strong>1975</strong> - The Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS
          Records,[47] and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this
          time;
          Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career.</li>

        <li><strong>1978</strong> - In 1978, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, a musical directed by Sidney Lumet. It costarred Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross. The film was a box-office failure. Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums. During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as "Working Day and Night"</li>

        <li><strong>1981</strong> - Jackson recorded with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There Must Be More to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio, and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use. The songs were released in 2014.</li>
